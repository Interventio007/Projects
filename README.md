Snake Game:

Its a very basic snake game, for now the snake movement speed is fixed and the game is not complete, game runs without a hitch and the game just pauses if the snake hits the edge of the window or hits itself, to restart the game re-run the program.

It does not display any score on the screen but is displayed on the terminal once you crash the snake.
